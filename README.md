# Hip-Hop Hangman

This fun web app asks you to figure out the right hip-hop artist by guessing letters that appear in the artist's name. You get 9 incorrect guesses before you loose the round. Win or loose, you get to watch a video of the artist at the end of each round. The app uses 7Digital's API to get a list of top 100 hip-hop artists and the YouTube API to show the related video.
